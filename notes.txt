base facts:
- colliders are invisible
{
    - growl makes the first colliding thing in every direction visible
OR
    - growl shoot waves that get reflected by invisible walls
}

1.
- top down 2D map
- automated 2D horizontal side scroller
- bat is visible
- walls are invisible
- bat is movable on 2 axes
- bat is faster than scroller
- bat can growl to trigger sound waves that turn obstacles visible for a short time

2.
- there are gongs that create new (maybe weaker) soundwaves when they are hit by one -> chain reaction by level design
